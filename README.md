# Project_Crossword_Assignment
## Project overview
Our group has chosen to create a web based crossword game designed for children aged 10-14 (although were planning to make a sepertate version for adults). The aim is to make an educational and fun tool that helps the users improve their vocabulary, spelling and problem solving skills through the interactive gameplay.

## Project specification
The overall aim of this project is to design an engaging, educational web-based crossword that’s aimed at children aged 10 – 14 years of age. Our system will allow players to Input their answers into a designated bar along with having numbered squares which would correspond to clues on the side. These clues would be revealed and answered by clicking on the appropriate number. users will be able to type answers into a small bar and if correct will be added to the grid. If the input is incorrect the system will let the user know that what they tped was wrong and that answer wont be added to the grid. This application will be developed using HTML, CSS and python. The finished product will be deployed via GitHub pages.

## Target audience
 - Age group: 10 - 14 years old
 - Purpose: To help kids stregnthen thier fundamentals like vocabulary and spelling skills through an interactive experience

## Project Design and objectives
The game is going to feature a simple and visually clear interface with:
  - A grid layout
  - Readable text
  - Easy colour coded navigation between clues
Feedback would be helpful, guiding players through the crossword.
Once we get the game up and running, we plan to add 2 extra difficuties:
  - Easy: shorter more simpler words (tailored for students)
  - Hard: Longer more challenging words (better for teachers)

## Functional and nonfuncional requirments 

 ### Functional 
  - The crossword will be in a gird layout where players can see the legnth of the word by counting the number of cells
  - Players can enter their ansewer into an input bar below the grid
  - when a player inputs an answer either a completion message  if correct or an error message if incorrect will appear 
  - Once all words are guessed correctly, a final completion messsage will pop up to confirm the puzzle is complete
  - Users will have the option to restart the game at any time by ressing the reset button
  - a difficulty section including easy, medium and hard which would vary the grid sizes and complexity of the words
  - the corssword will have numbered and coloured cells that correspond to a list of culues displayed on the side of the grid
  - The crossword will be functional on web broswers making it compatible on desktop and Laptop

## Nonfunctional 
  - The interface will be simple, clear and easy to navigate so users can quickly understand how to play
  - Designerd to be used by 10-14 year olds however by adding a difficulty system, older more intelligent people can play
  - A simple and school appropriate desgin will keep the game engaging without being distracting
  - the system will be reliable and robust
  - The system should be able to run on different operating systems e.g Mac OS, Windows.

## System requirments 

### Hardware
 - Dual core CPU
 - Minimum 4GB RAM
 - Minimum resolution of 1280×720
 - Keyboard and Mouse

-	Potential risks to the project’s success: (not including time management)
  There are some potential risks involved affecting the success of the project; if we were to rank them in order it would be:

 	1. Technical Knowledge, we all have limited knowdlege and experience in python and coding in general. This could cause delays and issues in development as we would spend time trying to figure out how to implement the code and our ideas. This is the main issue for our project due to lack of knowledge and experiecne we may not have it to a great quality.
  2. Trying to add optional features and things to make the game better will be hard for us due to the lack of time given to complete the project. If we spend too much resources on one feature then we won't be able to focus on important parts and developing the functionality of the game
  3. Testing issues may occur due to various devices not being compatible with our game. Also, we will not be able to recieve real user feedback from our target audience which leads to less usabilty improvments.
  4. Our releiance on external libraries might cause compatibility issues or even if we use external images or other things there could be an issue due to licensing. Also another, issue we will face is conflicting changes on GitHub when we all commit changes at the same time.


Our software development strategy is the spiral methodology, which contains elements of other methods such as waterfall with its clearly defined phases, combined with an iterative development process. It is great for projects that contain a risk element to it, largely used for complicated, expensive projects. The main advantage of the spiral model is the “coil with many loops”. When the spiral model is visually presented, you can see these loops. This is to show the iterative process that you can go back to prior stages even after moving on and correct any mistakes and improve further. This means we can gradually release stages of the new system and make refinements, too, as time passes.
