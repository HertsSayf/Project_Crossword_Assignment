# Project_Crossword_Assignment
-	Chosen project: Crossword  
-	Target audience: children aged between 10 – 14 years because digital crosswords are good for developing vocabulary, spelling and problem skills. Crosswords can also be used as an educational tool in schools to further develop a student’s basic functional skills. 
-	Overall Specification:  The overall aim of this project is to design an engaging, educational web-based crossword that’s aimed at children aged 10 – 14 years of age. Our system will allow players to interact with the crossword grid having numbered squares which would correspond to clues on the side. These clues would be revealed and answered by clicking on the appropriate cell. Players will be able to type answers directly onto the grid and once the collum/ row is filled in the system will check whether the word entered is correct or not. The game will have an option to reset and attempt the puzzle again. This application will be developed using HTML, CSS and python. The finished product will be deployed via GitHub pages.

In terms of usability and quality, we will be creating a simple ad visually clear interface, with a grid, readable text and easy colour corresponding navigation between clues. Feedback would be supportive helping the player solve the problem. Furthermore if we manage to complete and get the core functionality of the game working, we shall attempt to add a harder version of the game in where either by creating auto generated crosswords or playing on a larger grid with more challenging words however this is still an idea and will only be attempted if we have enough time remaining. This project aims to provide a both entertaining and educational experience and viable tool that enhances vocabulary, spelling and problem-solving skills.

1)	Name: Liam Wigley 
About: Liam is a 12-year-old secondary school student who enjoys word games but sometimes struggles with spelling and remembering definitions. He uses computers at school and is comfortable with typing and using a mousepad along with touchscreen interactions. 
Relation to the project: Liam wants the crossword to be colourful, fun and easy to understand without needing complex instructions. For Liam the crossword is both entertaining and a way to help improve his vocabulary during his break or in class. 

2)	Name: Fred Coker 
About: Fred is a 40-year-old English teacher working at a secondary school. he is looking for a way to make lessons more engaging and interactive in order to support his students learning. Fred values tools that are easy to use and reliable along with-it being child friendly.
Relation to the project: For Fred the crossword is a class activity that can help achieve his goal of making classes more engaging and interactive. He needs the application to have a clean, professional layout with an option to restart the puzzle between classes. Fred appreciates software that is simple and clear from distractions as this helps keeps his students focused. 	

-	Functional requirements: the crossword will provide a fully interactive grid where players can click on cells which are numbered and reveal clues in relation to the puzzle. once a puzzle has been completed successfully the application will display a completion message to confirm the correct move. alternatively if a move is wrong it will either not fit or display an error message. In order for the game to be reuable, players will have the option to restart the game again. An additional feature under consideration is to add a diificulty system in which the user can pick different difficutly levels for the crossword which would vary in size and complexity. Wilth all these functions in place and working together should create a smooth and engaging experince for users. 


-	Nonfunctional requirements: The crossword will be created with usability and being accessible as its main goal. this ensures that the  target audiance can use the software  to the best of its ability. The interface will include a simple, vivd layout with visible text and simple controls so that users can quickly understand how to play without needing any complex instructions. The application will be able to run on both desktop and tablets, making it accesssable for students and teschers if they want to play from home or away from a computer. The overall design will follow a professional and school appropriate aesthetic to prevent making the game too distracting, reliable and enjoyable for both teachers and students.

-	Potential risks to the project’s success: (not including time management)
  There are some potential risks involved affecting the success of the project; if we were to rank them in order it would be:
 	1. Technical Knowledge, we all have limited knowdlege and experience in python and coding in general. This could cause delays and issues in development as we would spend time trying to figure out how to implement the code and our ideas. This is the main issue for our project due to lack of knowledge and experiecne we may not have it to a great quality.
  2. Trying to add optional features and thongs to make the game better will be hard for us due to the lack of time given to complete the project. If we spend too much resources on one feature then we won't be able to focus on important parts and developing the functionality of the game
  3. Testing issues may occur due to various devices not being compatible with our game. Also, we will not be able to recieve real user feedback from our target audience which leads to less usabilty improvments.
  4. Our releiance on external libraries might cause compatibility issues or even if we use external images or other things there could be an issue due to licensing. Also another, issue we will face is conflicting changes on GitHub when we all commit changes at the same time.
