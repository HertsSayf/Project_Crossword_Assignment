# Project_Crossword_Assignment
-	Chosen project: Crossword  
-	Target audience: children aged between 10 – 14 years because digital crosswords are good for developing vocabulary, spelling and problem skills. Crosswords can also be used as an educational tool in schools to further develop a student’s basic functional skills. 
-	Overall Specification:  The overall aim of this project is to design an engaging, educational web-based crossword that’s aimed at children aged 10 – 14 years of age. Our system will allow players to interact with the crossword grid having numbered squares which would correspond to clues on the side. These clues would be revealed and answered by clicking on the appropriate cell. Players will be able to type answers directly onto the grid and once the collum/ row is filled in the system will check whether the word entered is correct or not. The game will have an option to reset and attempt the puzzle again. This application will be developed using HTML, CSS and python. The finished product will be deployed via GitHub pages.

In terms of usability and quality, we will be creating a simple ad visually clear interface, with a grid, readable text and easy colour corresponding navigation between clues. Feedback would be supportive helping the player solve the problem. Furthermore if we manage to complete and get the core functionality of the game working, we shall attempt to add a harder version of the game in where either by creating auto generated crosswords or playing on a larger grid with more challenging words however this is still an idea and will only be attempted if we have enough time remaining. This project aims to provide a both entertaining and educational experience and viable tool that enhances vocabulary, spelling and problem-solving skills.
